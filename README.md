The Spica Library
=================

This is the Ada part of the [Spica meta-library](https://github.com/pchapin/spica).

This is an Ada library of unusual or specialized algorithms and data structures. It was created
largely as an exercise, but some effort has been made to implement the algorithms and data
structures here with enough quality to be useful.

The library, test program, and benchmark program can be built using
[Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/). The test program and benchmark program are separate crates from
the library.

Enjoy!
